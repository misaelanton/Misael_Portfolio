[Data Analyst Project #1](https://github.com/misaelanton/Misael_Portfolio/blob/main/Annual%20Car%20Sales%20at%20Mexico%202021.ipynb)
In this project I tried to clean and analyze data using python major libraries (Pandas and numpy). Data was obtained from the biggest institute of data in Mexico (INEGI) that corresponds to the number of cars sold and exported from Mexico. The goal was to obtain a bigger picture of how the pandemic affected the flows on the sales in the country.  


[Data Analyst Project #2](https://github.com/misaelanton/Misael_Portfolio/blob/main/Helmholtz%20Analysis.ipynb)
This major project was made to obtain a grade in the UC Berkeley for my physics class. It explores my skills in obtaining, cleaning, analyzing and visualizing results from a hand made - home made experiment using Python. 

[Exploratory Data Analysis and Machine Learning Prediction using Random Forest and Linear Regression in binary Classification](https://github.com/misaelanton/Misael_Portfolio/blob/main/Bank%20Data%20Challenge-%20Misael%20Antonio%20Jara%20Gonzalez.ipynb)
This last project is just a cliche from several other articles and bootcamps that I have taken. Some of the steps are guided and some are of my own. 

Hello Everyone, 
Throughout this profile you'd see some of my personal/academic projects in which I have worked on. 
I'm constantly working to improve my data analytic skills and visuals so any feedback is highly appriciated. 

I hope you guys enjoy,
